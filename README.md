# CNN-with-most-of-LeNet-architecture-hyperparameters-optimized-with-Optuna
CNN closely resembling LeNet, but with variable units within layers along with variable learning rate.

These variable hyperparameters will be optimized through the optuna frame work.

This code closely resembles a MLP example on their website: https://github.com/optuna/optuna-examples/blob/main/pytorch/pytorch_simple.py

The goal of this project was to play around with hyperparameter optimization.
